Description of Mycobacterium paraseoulense sp. nov.

Mycobacterium paraseoulense (pa.ra.se.oul.en′se. Gr. prep. para like; N.L. neut. adj. seoulense specific epithet of a bacterial species; N.L. neut. adj. paraseoulense like seoulense, referring to the genotypic resemblance of the type strain to Mycobacterium seoulense).
The bacillus stains acid-alcohol-fast. Cells are generally rod-shaped, with frequent curved cells. Spores and filaments are not present. The optimal growth temperature is 37 °C. No growth is observed at 45 °C. On Middlebrook 7H10 medium, mature growth develops in 3 weeks at 25 and 37 °C. Microcolonies develop in 2 weeks at the same temperatures. However, 4 weeks or more is required to form mature colonies on LJ medium. Colonies grown on Middlebrook 7H10 agar are usually larger, smooth, although occasionally rough, but always orange in appearance under both dark and photoinduction conditions. Cells on LJ medium grow in a film-like manner and produce an orange pigment. No growth is observed on MacConkey agar or on culture medium containing 5 % NaCl or 5 mg EMB ml−1. Negative for nitrate reductase, arylsulfatase, niacin accumulation and Tween 80 hydrolysis and positive for urease activity, heat-stable catalase, pyrazinamidase and tellurite reductase. Morphology and biochemical profiles are not distinguishable from those of M. scrofulaceum. HPLC analysis shows a unique mycolic acid profile. Genetically, although the 16S rRNA gene sequence is identical to that of M. seoulense, it has sequences unique within Mycobacterium for hsp65, rpoB and the ITS region. Phylogenetic analysis based on these three independent targets shows that M. paraseoulense belongs to the SGM and is closely related to the scotochromogenic species M. seoulense.
The type strain is 31118T (=DSM 45000T =KCTC 19145T), which was isolated from a human sputum sample.
